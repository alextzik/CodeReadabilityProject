# Measuring Readability with Clustering Methods

## Abstract
This assignment is about measuring the readability of code methods that are included in highly ranked projects on  Github. It aims at providing a way of measuring the readability, given certain characteristics and violations of each method. The approach taken is that of clustering. This study shows that dimensionality reduction can be applied to the original data and leads to the creation of easily distinguishable clusters that represent different levels of readability and simplicity. A couple of dimensionality reduction techniques were applied before clustering, and the results show that the best method is ICA.
